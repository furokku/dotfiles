# dots
these are the dotfiles that i use on my system.<br>included are: xmonad, rofi, neofetch, i3-gaps, i3status, dunst, alacritty, picom, polybar, neovim config files

## dunst
dunst got a bunch of config options deprecated and whatnot so half the config doesn't work since i haven't been able to fully fix it yet

dont yell at me if they dont work<br>some things are defined as absolute paths so change those

some wallpapers also included
