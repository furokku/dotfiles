# dots
these are the dotfiles that i use on my system.<br>included are: xmonad, rofi, neofetch, i3-gaps, i3status, dunst, alacritty, picom, polybar, neovim config files
<br>pretty much just a basic gruvbox + xmonad config

## dunst
~~dunst got a bunch of config options deprecated and whatnot so half the config doesn't work since i haven't been able to fully fix it yet~~ this has been fixed

## picom
picom got cut out from this config because of the issues it caused with window borders, however the file is still here if you want to use it

dont yell at me if they dont work<br>some things are defined as absolute paths so change those

some wallpapers also included
